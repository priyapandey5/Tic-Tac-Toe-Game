# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
I have design and implement a classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Allow players to click on empty cells to make their moves.
Prevent further moves after a game has ended (win or tie).
It display the game result when a player wins or when the game ends in a tie.
Provide a button to reset the game for a new round.
